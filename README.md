| `HTTP1`| `HTTP2` |
|------ | ------ |
| It works on the textual format. | It works on the binary protocol.|
|There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources. | It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests. |
| It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages |	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
| It compresses data by itself.	| It uses HPACK for data compression.

+ HTTP is based on the Client/Server model. Client/Server model can be explained as two computers, each with their own [IP address](https://factory.dev/blog/http2-difference-from-http1).
